# Introduction
In this activity, I will be diving into the practical aspects of wireless networking by
configuring both a home router and a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)-based network. My objective is to implement robust security measures using WPA2-PSK and
WPA2-Enterprise protocols. The journey begins with setting up a home router to
enable Wi-Fi connectivity across various devices. Following that, I'll secure this
network using WPA2-PSK. Transitioning to a more complex setup, I will configure
interfaces and WLANs on a WLC. This involves securing the WLAN with
WPA2-PSK and WPA2-Enterprise, followed by connecting hosts and verifying their
connectivity. This hands-on experience will solidify my understanding of WLAN
configuration and security implementation

# Objectives

1. Configure a home router to provide Wi-Fi connectivity to a variety of devices
2. Configure WPA2-PSK security on a home router
3. Configure interfaces on a WLC
4. Configure WLANs on a WLC
5. Configure WPA2-PSK security on a WLAN and connect hosts to WLAN
6. Configure WPA2-Enterprise on a WLAN and connect hosts to the WLAN
7. Verify WLAN connectivity

# Methodology
## Part 1: Configure a Home Wireless Router
## i) Step 1: Change DHCP settings

I begun by opening the home wireless Router GUI and configured the router IP and DHCP settings where I enabled DHCP Server and set the router's IP address as 192.168.6.1 as shown below:

Once I configured the internet interface of the router to receive itâ€™s IP address over
DHCP the address it received was: **192.168.0.1**

## ii) Step 2: Configure the Wireless LAN

In order to complete this step I clicked on the wireless tab and set the SSID to
HomeSSID as described in the WLAN table. Next I selected channel 6 - 2.437 Ghz
and enabled SSID broadcast so that all the wireless hosts could see the broadcast as
shown in the picture below:
